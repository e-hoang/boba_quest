ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This project is a game called Boba Quest. The goal of the game is to find the ultimate boba shop. 
The player plays through a map going through boba shops and encountering challenges to reach the 
final boba shop. Challenges can help the player stay hydrated, or dehydrate the player, leading 
to the player losing the game. The player can buy drinks that can quench their thirst, but also 
have a small chance of being made wrong and thus dehydrating the player. Once the player finds
the ultimate boba shop, the player wins and the game is over.
